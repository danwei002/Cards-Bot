This is a discord bot I am working on that will support numerous types of playing card games, such as Texas Hold 'Em, President, etc. Data is stored and accessed using a MySQL database. This bot is written in Python using the discord.py library found <a href="https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"> here</a>.
<br>
<br>
Current features:
- Random card drawing
- Random card generation
- Some customizability of hand displays
- Texas Hold 'Em
- President
- Betting functionality
- Basic economy system

Currently working on:
- Five-card Draw
- General refinements to bot
