# Discord Playing Cards Bot
This is a discord bot I am working on that will support numerous types of playing card games, such as Texas Hold 'Em, President, etc. Data is stored and accessed using a MySQL database. This bot is written in Python using the discord.py library found <a href="https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"> here<\a>.
